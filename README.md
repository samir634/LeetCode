# LeetCode
I am using ChatGPT to generate LeetCode solutions and storing those solutions here

The point of this is to store the knowledge for my reference later, as well as emphasize to people I share this repository with, memorizing LeetCode solutions is not a viable way to measure success for a developer. 
What is helpful is a developer that can explain the solutions, understand the code, and understand where to use them.

This reposistory is primarily working with Python, Python 2 or 3. The goal will be to fully transition over to 3.
